**Drawer Navigator**
* Takes more dependencies than navigatory

~~What needs to be done from here~~
~~* Need to make another cli, and get to the point where you are able to debug and make changes so that you are
able to work on the counter and all the other in class assignments~~
~~* Rewatch video to get an idea of what you need to catch up on~~

# ~~Get the counter working~~

# onClick
* The curly brace makes it so you are passing onClick a function, so when someone presses it, then it does the function, if you just passed the function into the onClick without the curly, it just does it right away which is not what you want
* In general when you have a {} in react, it means that there is going to be jsx or a function that is going to be passed through
