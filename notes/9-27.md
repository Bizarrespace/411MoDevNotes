# Final project
* Ideas want to build something where, given a location, you can find out the most listened-to song/genre in that area, and you can expand the search area range
* Useful list to find out what areas are listening to what
* Maybe API calls to spotify? Need to find out what database has this data in the first place

# Promises
* .finally(), do this once the promise is made, if you do not catch the error, the finally function gets ran, and then it throws an exception

# Promises vs Await
* Promises is data, await is a control structure
