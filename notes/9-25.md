# Async/Await 
* Imperative programming:
  * Where you do one thing, wait for it to finish, and then do another thing, basic programming
  * Problem comes up when you have stuff where you do not know how long it is going to take
  * Maybe it does not finish
* Asynchoronous Programming:
  * We don't want to wait for things to finish and then do something
  * Ex: You want info from 100 cites, and scrap it, if you went down the line it would take forever
    * Because 1 might make you wait, but if you did async just do whatever website comes back first, and work on ones that are ready next
    * Real world example of this:
      * Cooking, you dont just wait for the pan fry to finish cooking and then get the rice, you can just get the rice and check in on the pan and work with it once its done
* Terminology:
  * Task: Set of instructions in a row
  * Synchronous: Happens as you request it, only continue when you are done
  * Asynchronous: Happens some time in the future. Can't control when its done
* JS and things we need to wait for
  * How does JS gets things done?
    * Event loop, tasks queue, 2 more task queues that are more important than your stuff, and something about having a queue that is even more important than what you put in the event loop that it has to keep checking
    * JS is also single-threaded but can simulate asynchronous things
    * Stopped at 32:50
* Java's current model:
  * Promises:
    * Value that might not be ready
    * States: Pending, Resolved, rejected
    * Only promises have these states, can not ask a promise what state it is in
      * Just let the promise keep track of the state that it is in
  * Summary of most used methods:
    * You resolve() and reject() promises
    * .then to get the result from resolve()
    * .catch to get the result from reject()
``` javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (Math.random() < .6) {
        reject("Failed");
    }
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Success");
    }, 3000);
});

console.log(promise);

promise
    .then((returnedValue) => { console.log(returnedValue);}) //This is how you get the returned value from the promise 
    .catch((err) => {console.log(err);}) //This is how you get the error
;
```
   * Use Await, it is syntax sugar for .then
``` javascript
(async () => {
  const result = await i_want_a_promise();
  console.log(result)
})(); 
```
* We here are using a immediately invoked function expression, you can tell because we have a function with (async () => { ... }) and then the '()' after is what envokes it
* The await only works if you have it in an async

* This will return before, after, result
  * Reason for this is because of how you are waiting 1 second for the promise to finish, JS goes through the code, does before, makes a promise, and then moves on to do the after, then the promise finish and JS logs the result
