# Immunitabilty 
* If you assign an object to something, and then you assign it to something else, you are not changing anything you are just assigning the object something completely different
* Ex:
  * x = 4;
  * x = 5;
    * Here the 4 does not change to become the 5, rather 5 is something completely different and x gets assigned to it
    * x is NOT immutable, but objects are

# If you got time do the 3 screens
* Home where you show the number
* Add where you add one to the number
* Reset where you make the number go back to 0
* Use context to allow the 3 screens to see the number and work with it with their own independent functions
